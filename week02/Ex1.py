 Create your own functions to compute integrals using the trapezoidal rule and 
 Simpsonâ€™srule. These functions should take as input an array with the x  and y
 values of the function to be integrated. Hint: notice that the book has an 
 example program to execute the trapezoidal rule already, Sec. 5.1, Example 5.1
